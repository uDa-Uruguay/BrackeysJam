  - Hey! Are you the new soul? It's so nice to meet you! Name's Robbert.
  - I know we have just met, but can I ask you a favor?
  - Would you help me find some objects I've lost?
  - As an old soul myself, I keep forgetting things about my life as a living creature.
    These objects allow me to remember.
  - 'The things I need are: an old photograph of myself, my favorite meal and the
    last birthday cake I''ve had.'
  - Thank you so much!
